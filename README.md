## Prac 1
This practical is for getting comfortable interfacing with the Raspberry Pi and GPIO basics, as well as exposure to git.

This prac is a simple 3-bit binary counter, the value of which will be placed on LEDs connected to the Pi. The value on the counter should change depending on a button press. One button is to increase the value, and another button to decrease the value.

### Prac1/prac-one.py is the file that has all the source code for the prac. It is the file to run.
